# DOM Overview

The DOM (or Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage - a tree of “nodes” with different relationships depending on how they’re arranged in the HTML document.  

Javascript can be used to interact with DOM elements. In other words, you can add HTML and CSS elements using Javascript.
